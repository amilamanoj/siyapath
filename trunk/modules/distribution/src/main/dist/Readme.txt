Siyapath : P2P Volunteer Computing Framework with gossip protocols

High performance computing addresses the demands on computationally intensive tasks.
Volunteer computing is one approach to tackle with high performance computing requirements.

Siyapath is an open source distributed volunteer computing framework prototype.
It takes a new approach in solving the problem of high performance computing.

Siyapath can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in a distributed manner by utilizing
computational power volunteered by the general public.
