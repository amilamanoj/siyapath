#summary Introduction to project Siyapath

= Siyapath =

The proposed project, Siyapath, is a volunteer computing framework which can be used to perform high throughput computing by utilizing computational power volunteered by the general public. Having a distributed peer-to-peer architecture, Siyapath is also highly scalable. The framework is platform independent and is fault tolerant. Gossip protocol introduced for communication  adds robustness and scalability to Siyapath.
